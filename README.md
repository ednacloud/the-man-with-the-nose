This is a demo project, based on __The Man with the Nose__, a short story by Rhoda Broughton (1840-1920).

The story is included in the collection __Twilight Stories__, published by Victorian Secrets.

Rhoda Broughton’s __Twilight Stories__ was first published as __Tales for Christmas Eve__ in 1873. The tales had also appeared in the literary magazine __Temple Bar__, and have since been reproduced in ghost story anthologies throughout the decades. Readers have been impressed with Broughton’s ability to make the apparently mundane appear mysterious and, in some cases, terrifying.

Herbert van Thal, who edited the 1947 edition of __Twilight Stories__ wrote in his introduction:

> Twilight Stories should excite the most blasé follower of the tale that should be read ‘last thing at night’…Miss Broughton was clearly a forerunner of M R James.
